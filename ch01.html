                <li>The company that popularized personal computing was <u>Apple Computer</u>.
                <li>The computer that made personal computing legitimate in business and industry was the <u>IBM PC</u>.
                <li>Computers process data under the control of sets of instructions called <u>programs</u>.
                <li>The key logical units of the computer are the <u>primary memory</u>, <u>secondary memory</u>, <u>central processing unit</u>, <u>arithmetic-logic unit</u>, <u>input unit</u>, and <u>output unit</u>.
                <li>The three types of languages discussed in the chapter are <u>machine languages</u>, <u>assembly languages</u>, and <u>high-level languages</u>.
                <li>The programs that translate high-level language programs into machine language are called <u>compilers</u>.
                <li>The <u>World Wide Web</u> allows computer users to locate and view multimedia-based documents on almost any subject over the Internet.
                <li><u>Multithreading</u> allows a Java program to perform multiple activities in parallel.
            </ol>
            <li><ol class="q2">
                <li>The <u><code>java</code></u> command from the JDK executes a Java application.
                <li>The <u><code>javac</code></u> command from the JDK compiles a Java program.
                <li>A Java program file must end with the <u><code>.java</code></u> file extension.
                <li>When a Java program is compiled, the file produced by the compiler ends with the <u><code>.class</code></u> extension.
                <li>The file produced by the Java compiler contains <u>Bytecodes</u> that are executed by the Java Virtual Machine.
            </ol>
            <li><ol class="q2">
                <li>Objects have the property of <u>information hiding</u>&mdash;although objects may know how to communicate with one another across well-defined interfaces, they normally are not allowed to know how other objects are implemented.
                <li>Java programmers concentrate on creating <u>classes</u>, which contain fields and the set of methods that manipulate those fields and provide services to clients.
                <li>Classes can have relationships called <u>associations</u> with other classes.
                <li>The process of analysing and designing a system from an object-oriented point of view is called <u>OOD</u>.
                <li>OOD takes advantage of <u>inheritance</u> relationships, where new classes of objects are derived by absorbing characteristics of existing classes, then adding unique characteristics of their own.
                <li><u>UML</u> is a graphical language that allows people who design software systems to use an industry-standard notation to represent them.
                <li>The size, shape, colour, and weight of an object are considered <u>attributes</u> of the object's class.
            </ol>
            <li><ol class="q2">
                <li>CPU: <u>hardware</u>
                <li>Java compiler: <u>software</u>
                <li>JVM: <u>software</u>
                <li>input unit: <u>hardware</u>
                <li>editor: <u>software</u>
            </ol>
            <li><ol class="q2">
                <li>The logical unit of the computer that receives information from outside the computer for use by the computer is the <u>input unit</u>.
                <li>The process of instructing the computer to solve a problem is called <u>programming</u>.
                <li><u>Assembly Language</u> is a type of computer language that uses English-like abbreviations for machine-language instructions.
                <li><u>Output Unit</u> is a logical unit of the computer that sends information that has already been processed by the computer to various devices so that it may be used outside the computer.
                <li><u>Primary Memory</u> and <u>secondary memory</u> are logical units of the computer that retain information.
                <li><u>ALU</u> is a logical unit of the computer that performs calculations.
                <li><u>CPU</u> is a logical unit of the computer that makes logical decisions.
                <li><u>High-level</u> languages are most convenient to the programmer for writing programs quickly and easily.
                <li>The only language a computer can directly language is that computer's <u>machine language</u>.
                <li><u>CPU</u> is a logical unit of the computer that coordinates the activities of all the other logical units.
            </ol>
            <li>Fatal errors cause the program to terminate abnormally, whilst non-fatal errors may allow the program to terminate normally but produce incorrect results.  Fatal errors immediately notify the programmer of a program, but non-fatal errors are more difficult to find.
            <li><ol class="q2">
                <li><u>Java</u> is now used to develop large-scale enterprise applications, to enhance the functionality of web servers, to provide applications for consumer devices, and for many other purposes.
                <li><u>C#</u> was designed specifically for the .NET platform to enable programmers to migrate easily to .NET.
                <li><u>C</u> initially became widely known as the development language of the UNIX operating system.
                <li><u>BASIC</u> was developed at Dartmouth College in the mid-1960s as a means of writing simple programs.
                <li><u>FORTRAN</u> was developed by IBM Corporation in the mid-1950s to be used for scientific and engineering applications that require complex mathematical computations.
                <li><u>COBOL</u> is used for commercial applications that require precise and efficient manipulation of large amounts of data.
                <li>The <u>C++</u> programming language was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in the early 1980s at Bell Laboratories.
            </ol>

                <li>Java programs normally go through five phases&mdash;<u>edit</u>, <u>compile</u>, <u>load</u>, <u>verify</u>, and <u>execute</u>.
                <li>An <u>IDE</u> provides many tools that support the software-development process, such as editors for writing and editing programs, debuggers for locating logic errors in programs, and many other features.
                <li>The command <code>java</code> invokes the <u>JVM</u>, which executes Java programs.
                <li>A <u>VM</u> is a software application that simultates a computer, but hides the underlying operating system and hardware from the programs that interact with it.
                <li>A <u>portable</u> program can run on multiple platforms.
                <!-- Java?-->
                <li>The <u>class loader</u> takes the <code>.class</code> files containing the program's bytecodes and transfers them to primary memory.
                <li>The <u>bytecode verifier</u> examines bytecodes to ensure that they are valid.
            </ol>
            <li>Firstly, the Java compiler translates Java source code into bytecodes, creating <code>.class</code> files.  Next, the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) uses a JIT compilation to translate the bytecodes to machine language.
            <li><ol class="q2">
                <li>object: the watch is the object, describing various parts, behaviours, and qualities of the watch
                <li>attributes: qualities of the watch, such as colour, size, weeight, material, brand name, prices, etc.
                <!-- the time! -->
                <li>behaviours: things one can do with the watch, such as read the time, set the watch, and start and stop the chronograph
                <li>class: that which describes watches in general, such as a generic diagram of a wristwatch, etc.
                <li>inheritance: all watches have the most basic attributes and behaviours of any watch, such as size or reading the time
                <!-- also, a watch would inherit from clocks -->
                <li>abstraction: rather than describing such a device as individual parts, e.g., a needle, a quartz movement, a strap, a battery, and so on, one can describe it simply as a "watch", representing the object in a human-meaningful way
                <li>modeling: one can model a watch using a schematic, pictoral, 2D representation like a blueprint
                <li>messages: a watch may send messages like audible beeps to the user, and the user may adjust the watch using the crown
                <li>encapsulation: the watch includes behaviours and attributes
                <li>interface: the watch's crown, etc. used to interface w/ it
                <li>information hiding: one cannot see the inside of a watch, which implements the watch behaviour
