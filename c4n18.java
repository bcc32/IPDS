/*
define and initialize variables (accNum, balance, charge, credits, limit)
prompt for numbers one by one, where accNum prompt tells user to input 0 to quit
while accNum != 0:
    balance += charges - credits
    if balance > limit:
        print "Credit Limit Exceeded"
    prompt for accNum, balance, charge, credits, limits like before
hopefully the loop ends and the user runs out of accounts here...
