            <li><code>product</code> becomes <u>25</u>, whilst <code>x</code> becomes <u>6</u>, since <code>x</code> is first used to multiply, then incremented (postincrementation).
            <li>Identify and correct the errors in each of the following sets of code
            <ol class="q2">
                <li>The opening curly brace of the <code>while</code> statement is not matched with a respective closing curly brace.  Correct by placing a closing right brace after <code>++c;</code>.
                <li>There should not be a semicolon after the <code>else</code> statement.  Correct by removing said semicolon.
            </ol>
            <li>This <code>while</code> statement does not contain any statement that would cause <code>z &gt;= 0</code> to be false; thus, the <code>while</code> loop will never finish and will result in an infinite loop.
            <li>Both statements execute the following code if and only if the condition specified is true.  However, a <code>if</code> statement will execute it only once, and a <code>while</code> statement will execute it until the condition is rendered false (or, if it is not, the statement will repeat indefinitely).
            <li>When Java devides an integer by another, <i>integer</i> division is performed, not regular algebraic division.  This means that the fractional part of the calculation is lost (e.g., <code>5 / 2 == 2</code> is true).  This can be avoided by using floating-point numbers or by storing the remainder and processing it some other way.
            <li>Control statements can be combined by:
            <ol class="q2">
                <li><u>Nesting</u> (one inside another)
                <li><u>Stacking</u> (one after another)
            </ol>
            <li>To repeat something a known number of times, <u>counter-controlled repetition</u> is used.  To repeat something an unknown number of times, <u>sentinel-controlled repetition</u> is used.
        </ol>
        <ol class="q1" start=27>
            <li><code>x = 9, y = 11</code> and <code>x = 11, y = 9</code>
            <ol class="q2">
                <li><code>"*****\n$$$$$\n"</code> and <code>"$$$$$\n"</code> are printed
                <li><code>"*****\n"</code> and <code>"#####\n$$$$$\n"</code> are printed
            </ol>
        </ol>
